Some things I learnt in Github, is all about using signs like (#) in front of the word or phrase. I also founded out that the depending on the number of hashatgs you write, corresponds to the heading level. Like writing one hastag results in saying 'heading level 1' and writing 6 gives you 'heading level 6'. This made me wonder, why is it not possible to get 'heading level 7' even though you wrote the right amount of hashtag.
